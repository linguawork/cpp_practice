# -pp.practice
This are just the learning notes with the code to understand the concepts of cpp (mainly std 98). And this is also a repo for GIT practice.

The files may include the code which I found on the Internet and reproduced for learning purpose. 

The main sources are the educational ones: "simple code" channel and "ravesli" web-site. 

The files may have a lot of comments in Russian and English.
